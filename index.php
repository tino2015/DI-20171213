                            We will take a detailed brief, get a feel for the space, and establish a scope of work together. We'll also talk about your budget and others involved in the project, such as your architect, builder, electrician, etc.
                            <p>
                            It’s also the perfect time for you to ask any questions about the design process and learn more about similar past projects and experience.

                            This stage is one of the most important during the process as it will determine your future interior. We'll discuss, review, and update the scope as needed until you are fully happy. Once agreed, we will start to work on the concept design for your project.

                            <p>
                            If the site doesn’t allow a survey, we'll still be able to work from an architect’s plan or any measurements provided from the site.

                <p>"Delphine helped me tremendously with a new project - a Restaurant and Function room renovation. Delphine had great ideas and helped me source some beautiful items that I wouldn’t have come across otherwise. Delphine worked with my budget and came on site to help more than once which was invaluable. I’d highly recommend Delphine Interiors."

                <p class="hideme">"We had a very urgent refurbishment job on our two bed flat in Putney/Wandsworth. Delphine was immediately able to articulate what could be delivered in the time frame, and those items for which we would have to wait a little. Her ideas, taste and design feel for the project was 'spot on' and we handed the whole project over to her. It was delivered on time, and on budget. The finished product has transformed our apartment! She was delightful to work with, reliable and very energetic. We will definitely use her again and recommend her without hesitation!"

                <p class="hideme">"I have recently bought a flat in London and out of all the professionals I have been working with, Delphine definitely stood out for being extremely proactive and helpful in advising us on how to furnish and decorate our new home. I don’t know much in this field and she patiently answered all my questions and helped me understand which of my ideas were practically feasible and which weren’t. She is exceptionally talented and creative so she came up with solutions I would never have thought of myself, and she talked to contractors on my behalf to give me rough quotes for each little project. Her drawings and plans are very clear and they are very helpful when trying to understand space in a new home and picturing how and where the furniture you have in mind would fit. She also adds notes and comments here and there to explain things that may not be obvious at a first glance. I would definitely recommend her and hope to be able to work with her again in the future."
